The first file contains statistics about various dinosaurs. 
The second file contains additional data.

Given the following formula, speed = ((STRIDE_LENGTH / LEG_LENGTH) - 1) * SQRT(LEG_LENGTH * g)
Where g = 9.8 m/s^2 (gravitational constant)

write a program to read data files, and print the names of the bipedal dinosaurs from fastest to slowest
